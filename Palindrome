 1. Palindrome Number
🔍 What is a Palindrome Number?
A number is called a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:

121 → Palindrome

123 → Not a palindrome

1331 → Palindrome

🧠 Logic:
To check if a number is a palindrome:

Reverse the digits of the number.

Compare the reversed number with the original.

If both are equal, it’s a palindrome.

🧑‍💻 Python Code:

def is_palindrome(num):
    original = str(num)
    reversed_num = original[::-1]
    return original == reversed_num

# Test
n = 121
if is_palindrome(n):
    print(f"{n} is a Palindrome")
else:
    print(f"{n} is not a Palindrome")
📝 Output:
121 is a Palindrome
